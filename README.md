# Stock Analysis
Module 2 VBA
During this analysis there were 12 green stocks analyzed for years 2017 & 2018. The analysis showed a year over year for trading and the ability to change the year by using macros. Steve, recently graduated with a degree in Financ and his first client were his parents.  They wanted him to look into DAQO stocks and analyze all the data so his parents can see a YoY on different trends. All findings for the project can be found here: [Green Stocks](https://github.com/EJones621/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm)
